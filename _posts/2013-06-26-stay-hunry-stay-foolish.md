今天浏览朗易思听时偶然发现了帮主当年在stanford得演讲，于是毫不犹豫下再下来又听了一遍，帮主的表述简练且铿锵有力，你丝毫听不出一点与病魔斗争的影子，再来欣赏以下帮主留给我们的箴言吧：


#### 谈到在Reed colleage 的经历时:

You cant connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards. 
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.
You have to trust in something, your gut,destiny,life,karma,whatever.
Because believing that the dots will connnect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path , and that will make all the difference.


#### 谈到从苹果离开的经历时:

You work is going to fill a large part of your life.and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you  believe is great work.and the only way to do great work is to love what you do.If you haven't found it yet, keep looking, and don't settle.Keep looking, Don't settle!
     
#### 谈到死亡

Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people;s thinking, Don't let the noise of others'opinions drown out your own inner voice, And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
